# House_Price_Prediction
Implemention of supervised statistical learning algorithms for predtion of house price. I have used <b>Linear Regression</b> algorithm to predict the housing price using the <b>ParisHousing.csv</b> dataset. <br><br>

## Dataset <br>
The "ParisHousing.csv" dataset is collected from Kaggle. Dataset is available here: <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/paris-housing-price-prediction" target = "_blank">ParisHousing.csv</a>
## Linear Regression <br>
It is a supervised learning algorithm which uses statistical method to make predictions for continuous/real or numerical values. This algorithm is used for predicting sales, salary, weather, age, product price etc. More on Linear Regression <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/linear-regression-in-machine-learning" target = "_blank">JavaPoint</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a>
